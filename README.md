## About

Advent of Code is an annual event that provides a series of programming challenges throughout the month of December. Each day, a new problem is released, and this repository contains my solutions to those problems.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year and day:


Each `dayXX` directory contains:
- `solution.py`: The Python script with the solution for that day's challenge.
- `input.txt`: The input data for the challenge.
- `README.md`: A brief description of the problem and solution.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions locally, you need to have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-solutions.git
cd advent-of-code-solutions
```

## Usage
cd 2023/day01
